# An opinionated list of 100 Numpy Exercises that are useful for ARENA.

(Disclaimers: 1. This is what was helpful for me, who had no numpy knowledge. 2. I'm assuming that one would generally do them in order 3. I only did through exercise 86, so there may be helpful exercises at the end that I missed.)



## The most important exercises (30):

1, 3, 6-9, 11-16, 19-22, 24, 25, 29, 35, 37, 39, 40, 42, 45, 50, 52, 67, 71, 86

## Still useful exercises from 51-100 (6):

53, 58, 59, 65, 69, 75.

## Tier 2 helpfulness (11):
