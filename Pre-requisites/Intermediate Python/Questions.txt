Here they are:

*args and **kwargs:

Write a function called print_args_kwargs that takes any number of positional and keyword arguments and prints them out separately.

Using set to find duplicates:

Write a function find_duplicates that takes a list of integers and returns a list of the duplicate elements using a set.

Decorators:

Create a decorator called timer that measures and prints the execution time of the decorated function.

A data structure from Collections:

Use defaultdict from the collections module to count the occurrences of words in a given string, ignoring case.

Zip and unzip:

Write a function that takes two lists of equal length, zips them together, performs a simple operation (like multiplying the paired elements), and then unzips the result.

For/else:

Write a function that searches for a prime number in a given range of numbers. If found, print the number and break the loop. If not found, use the else clause to print a message.
